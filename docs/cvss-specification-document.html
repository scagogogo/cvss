    <p>Document Version: 1.2</p>
    <p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is an open framework for
    communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. CVSS
    consists of four metric groups: Base, Threat, Environmental, and Supplemental.
    The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are
    constant over time and across user environments, the Threat group reflects the
    characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time, and the Environmental
    group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability that are unique to a
    user's environment. Base metric values are combined with default values that
    assume the highest severity for Threat and Environmental metrics to produce a
    score ranging from 0 to 10. To further refine a resulting severity score, Threat
    and Environmental metrics can then be amended based on applicable threat
    intelligence and environmental considerations. Supplemental metrics do not
    modify the final score, and are used as additional insight into the
    characteristics of a vulnerability. A CVSS vector string consists of a
    compressed textual representation of the values used to derive the score. This
    document provides the official specification for CVSS version 4.0.</p>
    <p>The most current CVSS resources can be found at <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/">https://www.first.org/cvss/</a></p>
    <p>CVSS is owned and managed by FIRST.Org, Inc. (FIRST), a US-based non-profit
    organization, whose mission is to help computer security incident response teams
    across the world. FIRST reserves the right to update CVSS and this document
    periodically at its sole discretion. While FIRST owns all rights and interest in
    CVSS, it licenses it to the public freely for use, subject to the conditions
    below. Membership in FIRST is not required to use or implement CVSS. FIRST does,
    however, require that any individual or entity using CVSS give proper
    attribution, where applicable, that CVSS is owned by FIRST and used by
    permission. Further, FIRST requires as a condition of use that any individual or
    entity which publishes CVSS data conforms to the guidelines described in this
    document and provides both the score and the vector string so others can
    understand how the score was derived.</p>
    <h1 id="Introduction">Introduction</h1>
    <p>The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) captures the principal technical
    characteristics of software, hardware and firmware vulnerabilities. Its outputs
    include numerical scores indicating the severity of a vulnerability relative to
    other vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>CVSS is composed of four metric groups: Base, Threat, Environmental, and
    Supplemental. The Base Score reflects the severity of a vulnerability according
    to its intrinsic characteristics which are constant over time and assumes the
    reasonable worst-case impact across different deployed environments. The Threat
    Metrics adjust the severity of a vulnerability based on factors, such as the
    availability of proof-of-concept code or active exploitation. The Environmental
    Metrics further refine the resulting severity score to a specific computing
    environment. They consider factors such as the presence of mitigations in that
    environment and the criticality attributes of the vulnerable system. Finally,
    the Supplemental Metrics describe and measure additional extrinsic attributes of
    a vulnerability, intended to add context.</p>
    <p>Base Metrics, and optionally Supplemental Metrics, are provided by the
    organization maintaining the vulnerable system, or a third party assessment on
    their behalf. Threat and Environmental information is available to only the end
    consumer. Consumers of CVSS should enrich the Base metrics with Threat and
    Environmental metric values specific to their use of the vulnerable system to
    produce a score that provides a more comprehensive input to risk assessment
    specific to their organization. Consumers may use CVSS information as input to
    an organizational vulnerability management process that also considers factors
    that are not part of CVSS in order to rank the threats to their technology
    infrastructure and make informed remediation decisions. Such factors may
    include, but are not limited to: regulatory requirements, number of customers
    impacted, monetary losses due to a breach, life or property threatened, or
    reputational impacts of a potential exploited vulnerability. These factors are
    outside the scope of CVSS.</p>
    <p>The benefits of CVSS include the provisioning of a standardized vendor and
    platform agnostic vulnerability scoring methodology. It is an open framework,
    providing transparency to the individual characteristics and methodology used to
    derive a score.</p>
    <h2 id="Metrics">Metrics</h2>
    <p>CVSS is composed of four metric groups: Base, Threat, Environmental, and
    Supplemental, each consisting of a set of metrics, as shown in Figure 1.</p>
    <p><img src="media/699c7730c6e9a411584a129153e334f4.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Figure 1: CVSS Metric Groups</strong></p>
    <p>The Base metric group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a
    vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. It is
    composed of two sets of metrics: the Exploitability metrics and the Impact
    metrics.</p>
    <p>The Exploitability metrics reflect the ease and technical means by which the
    vulnerability can be exploited. That is, they represent characteristics of the
    “<em>thing that is vulnerable”</em>, which we refer to formally as the “<em>vulnerable
    system”</em>. The Impact metrics reflect the direct consequence of a successful
    exploit, and represent the consequence to the “<em>things that suffer the impact”</em>,
    which may include impact on the vulnerable system and/or the downstream impact
    on what is formally called the “<em>subsequent system(s)”</em>.</p>
    <p>While the vulnerable system is typically a software application, operating
    system, module, driver, etc. (or possibly a hardware device), the subsequent
    system could be any of those examples but also includes human safety. This
    potential for measuring the impact of a vulnerability other than the vulnerable
    system, was a key feature introduced with CVSS v3.0. This property (formerly
    known as “Scope”), is captured by the separation of impacts to the vulnerable
    system and to subsequent systems, discussed later.</p>
    <p>The Threat metric group reflects the characteristics of a vulnerability related
    to threat that may change over time but not necessarily across user
    environments. For example, confirmation that the vulnerability has neither been
    exploited nor has any proof-of-concept exploit code or instructions publicly
    available will lower the resulting CVSS score. The values found in this metric
    group may change over time.</p>
    <p>The Environmental metric group represents the characteristics of a vulnerability
    that are relevant and unique to a particular consumers’ environment.
    Considerations include the presence of security controls which may mitigate some
    or all consequences of a successful attack, and the relative importance of a
    vulnerable system within a technology infrastructure.</p>
    <p>The Supplemental metric group includes metrics that provide context as well as
    describe and measure additional extrinsic attributes of a vulnerability. The
    response to each metric within the Supplemental metric group is to be determined
    by the CVSS consumer, allowing the usage of an end-user risk analysis system to
    apply locally significant severity to the metrics and values. No metric will,
    within its specification, have any impact on the final CVSS score (e.g.
    CVSS-BTE). Consumer organizations may then assign importance and/or effective
    impact of each metric, or set/combination of metrics, giving them more, less, or
    absolutely no effect on the categorization, prioritization, and assessment of
    the vulnerability. Metrics and values will simply convey additional extrinsic
    characteristics of the vulnerability itself.</p>
    <p>Each of these metrics are discussed in further detail below. The User Guide
    contains scoring rubrics for the Base Metrics that may be useful when scoring.</p>
    <h2 id="Assessment">Assessment</h2>
    <p>When the Base metrics are assigned values by an analyst, the Base metrics
    assessment results in a score ranging from 0.0 to 10.0.</p>
    <p>The Base metrics assessment can then be further refined by assessing the Threat
    and Environmental metrics in order to more accurately reflect the relative
    severity posed by a vulnerability to a user’s environment at a specific point in
    time. Assessment of the Threat and Environmental metrics is not required, but is
    highly recommended for more meaningful results.</p>
    <p>Generally, the Base metrics are specified by vulnerability bulletin analysts,
    product vendors, or application vendors because they typically possess the most
    accurate information about the characteristics of a vulnerability. The Threat
    and Environmental metrics are specified by consumer organizations because they
    are best able to assess the potential impact of a vulnerability within their own
    computing environment, at a given point in time.</p>
    <p>Assessing CVSS metrics also produces a vector string, a textual representation
    of the metric values used to derive a quantitative score and qualitative rating
    for the vulnerability. This vector string is a specifically formatted text
    string that contains each value assigned to each metric, and should be displayed
    with the vulnerability score.</p>
    <p>The scoring assessment and vector string are explained further below.</p>
    <p>Note that all metrics should be assessed under the assumption that the attacker
    has perfect knowledge of the vulnerability. That is, the analyst need not
    consider the means by which the vulnerability was identified. In addition, it is
    likely that many different types of individuals will be assessing
    vulnerabilities (e.g., software vendors, vulnerability bulletin analysts,
    security product vendors), however, note that CVSS assessment is intended to be
    agnostic to the individual and their organization.</p>
    <h2 id="Nomenclature">Nomenclature</h2>
    <p>Numerical CVSS Scores have very different meanings based on the metrics used to
    calculate them. Regarding prioritization, the usefulness of a numerical CVSS
    score is directly proportional to the CVSS metrics leveraged to generate that
    score. Therefore, numerical CVSS scores should be labeled using nomenclature
    that communicates the metrics used in its generation.</p>

    <h1 id="Base-Metrics">Base Metrics</h1>
    <h2 id="Exploitability-Metrics">Exploitability Metrics</h2>
    <p>As previously mentioned, the Exploitability metrics reflect the characteristics
    of the “<em>thing that is vulnerable”</em>, which we refer to formally as the
    vulnerable system. Therefore, each of the Exploitability metrics listed below
    should be assessed relative to the vulnerable system, and reflect the properties
    of the vulnerability that lead to a successful attack.</p>
    <p>When assessing Base metrics, it should be assumed that the attacker has advanced
    knowledge of the target system, including general configuration and default
    defense mechanisms (e.g., built-in firewalls, rate limits, traffic policing).
    For example, exploiting a vulnerability that results in repeatable,
    deterministic success should still be considered a Low value for Attack
    Complexity, independent of the attacker's knowledge or capabilities.
    Furthermore, target-specific attack mitigation (e.g., custom firewall filters,
    access lists) should instead be reflected in the Environmental metric scoring
    group.</p>
    <p>Specific configurations should not impact any attribute contributing to the CVSS
    Base metric assessment , i.e., if a specific configuration is required for an
    attack to succeed, the vulnerable system should be assessed assuming it is in
    that configuration.</p>
    <h3 id="Attack-Vector-AV">Attack Vector (AV)</h3>
    <p>This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is
    possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be
    larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order
    to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential
    attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is
    larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability
    requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater
    severity. The list of possible values is presented in Table 1.</p>

    <h3 id="Attack-Complexity-AC">Attack Complexity (AC)</h3>
    <p>This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to
    actively evade or circumvent <strong>existing built-in security-enhancing conditions</strong>
    in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose
    is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A
    vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower
    complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization.
    This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable
    system, and does not relate to the amount of time or attempts it would take for
    an attacker to succeed, e.g. a race condition. If the attacker does not take
    action to overcome these conditions, the attack will always fail.</p>
    <p>The evasion or satisfaction of authentication mechanisms or requisites is

    <h3 id="User-Interaction-UI">User Interaction (UI)</h3>
    <p>This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker,
    to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This

    of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must
    participate in some manner. The resulting score is greatest when no user

    </table>
    <h2 id="Impact-Metrics">Impact Metrics</h2>
    <p>The Impact metrics capture the effects of a successfully exploited
    vulnerability. Analysts should constrain impacts to a reasonable, final outcome
    which they are confident an attacker is able to achieve.</p>
    <p>Only an increase in access, privileges gained, or other negative outcome as a
    result of successful exploitation should be considered when assessing the Impact
    metrics of a vulnerability. For example, consider a vulnerability that requires
    read-only permissions prior to being able to exploit the vulnerability. After
    successful exploitation, the attacker maintains the same level of read access,
    and gains write access. In this case, only the Integrity impact metric should be
    scored, and the Confidentiality and Availability Impact metrics should be set as
    None.</p>
    <p>Note that when scoring a delta change in impact, the <strong>final impact</strong> should be
    used. For example, if an attacker starts with partial access to restricted
    information (Confidentiality Low) and successful exploitation of the
    vulnerability results in complete loss in confidentiality (Confidentiality
    High), then the resultant CVSS Base metric value should reference the “end game”
    Impact metric value (Confidentiality High).</p>
    <p>When identifying values for the impact metrics, assessment providers need to
    account for impacts both to the Vulnerable System and impacts outside of the
    Vulnerable System. These impacts are established by two sets of impact metrics:
    <em>“Vulnerable System impact”</em> and <em>“Subsequent System impact”</em>. When establishing
    the boundaries for the Vulnerable System metric values, assessment providers
    should use the conceptual model of a system of interest.</p>
    <p>Formally, a system of interest for scoring a vulnerability is defined as the set
    of computing logic that executes in an environment with a coherent function and
    set of security policies. The vulnerability exists in one or more components of
    such a system. A technology product or a solution that serves a purpose or
    function from a consumer's perspective is considered a system (e.g., a server,
    workstation, containerized service, etc.).</p>
    <p>When a system provides its functionality solely to another system, or it is
    designed to be exclusively used by another system, then together they are
    considered as the system of interest for scoring. For example, a database used
    solely by a smart speaker is considered a part of that smart speaker system.
    Both the database and the smart speaker it serves would be considered the
    vulnerable system if a vulnerability in that database leads to the malfunction
    of the smart speaker. When a vulnerability does not have impact outside of the
    vulnerable system assessment providers should leave the subsequent system impact
    metrics as NONE (N).</p>
    <p>All impacts, if any, that occur outside of the vulnerable system should be
    reflected in the subsequent system impact set. When assessed in the
    environmental metric group only, the subsequent system impact may, in addition
    to the logical systems defined for System of Interest, also include impacts to
    humans. This human impact option in the environmental metric group is explained
    further in Safety (S), below.</p>
    <h3 id="Confidentiality-VC-SC">Confidentiality (VC/SC)</h3>
    <p>This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information
    managed by the system due to a successfully exploited vulnerability.
    Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only
    authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to,
    unauthorized ones. The resulting score is greatest when the loss to the system
    is highest. The list of possible values is presented in Table 6 (for the
    Vulnerable System) and Table 7 (when there is a Subsequent System impacted).</p>

    <p>This metric measures the impact to the availability of the impacted system
    resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality
    and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity
    of <em>data</em> (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to
    the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked
    service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the
    accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth,
    processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system. The
    resulting score is greatest when the consequence to the system is highest. The
    list of possible values is presented in Table 10 (for the Vulnerable System) and

    <h1 id="Threat-Metrics">Threat Metrics</h1>
    <p>The Threat metrics measure the current state of exploit techniques or code
    availability for a vulnerability.</p>
    <h2 id="Exploit-Maturity-E">Exploit Maturity (E)</h2>
    <p>This metric measures the likelihood of the vulnerability being attacked, and is
    based on the current state of exploit techniques, exploit code availability, or
    active, “in-the-wild” exploitation. Public availability of easy-to-use exploit
    code or exploitation instructions increases the number of potential attackers by
    including those who are unskilled. Initially, real-world exploitation may only
    be theoretical. Publication of proof-of-concept exploit code, functional exploit
    code, or sufficient technical details necessary to exploit the vulnerability may
    follow. Furthermore, the available exploit code or instructions may progress
    from a proof-of-concept demonstration to exploit code that is successful in
    exploiting the vulnerability consistently. In severe cases, it may be delivered
    as the payload of a network-based worm or virus or other automated attack tools.</p>
    <p>It is the responsibility of the CVSS consumer to populate the values of Exploit
    Maturity (E) based on information regarding the availability of exploitation
    code/processes and the state of exploitation techniques. This information will
    be referred to as “threat intelligence” throughout this document.</p>
    <p>Operational Recommendation: Threat intelligence sources that provide Exploit
    Maturity information for all vulnerabilities should be preferred over those with
    only partial coverage. Also, it is recommended to use multiple sources of threat
    intelligence as many are not comprehensive. This information should be updated
    as frequently as possible and its application to CVSS assessment should be
    automated.</p>
    <p>The list of possible values is presented in Table 12. The more easily a
    vulnerability can be exploited, the higher the vulnerability score.</p>

    <p>These metrics enable the consumer analyst to customize the resulting score
    depending on the importance of the affected IT asset to a user’s organization,
    measured in terms of complementary/alternative security controls in place,
    Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. The metrics are the modified

    within organizational infrastructure.</p>
    <h2 id="Confidentiality-Integrity-and-Availability-Requirements-CR-IR-AR">Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Requirements (CR, IR, AR)</h2>
    <p>These metrics enable the consumer to customize the assessment depending on the
    importance of the affected IT asset to the analyst’s organization, measured in
    terms of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. That is, if an IT asset
    supports a business function for which Availability is most important, the
    analyst can assign a greater value to Availability metrics relative to
    Confidentiality and Integrity. Each Security Requirement has three possible
    values: Low, Medium, or High, or the default value of Not Defined (X).</p>
    <p>The full effect on the environmental score is determined by the corresponding
    Modified Base Impact metrics. Following the concept of assuming “reasonable
    worst case”, in absence of explicit values, these metrics are set to the default
    value of Not Defined (X), which is equivalent to the metric value of High (H).</p>
    <p>The list of possible values is presented in Table 13. For brevity, the same

    <h2 id="Modified-Base-Metrics">Modified Base Metrics</h2>
    <p>These metrics enable the consumer analyst to override individual Base metric
    values based on specific characteristics of a user’s environment.
    Characteristics that affect Exploitability or Impact can be reflected via an
    appropriately modified Environmental metric value.</p>
    <p>The full effect on the resulting score is determined by the corresponding Base
    metrics as follows</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>if the Modified Base Metric is Not Defined (X), the calculation of the score
    will use the value of the original Base Metrics</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>If the Modified Base Metric value is defined, then for the purpose of the
    calculation of the metric, the Base Metric value will be replaced by the
    Modified Base Metric value.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Example: If a provider sets the Base Metric Privileges Required to Low (PR:L)
    and an analyst overrides Modified Privileges Required to High (MPR:H), then the
    resulting score will be calculated as if the Base Metric Privileges Requires was
    set to High. Similarly, if a provider sets the Base Metric Attack Vector to
    Network (AV:N) and an analyst sets Modified Attack Vector to Physical (MAV:P),
    then the resulting score will be calculated as if the Base Attack Vector was set
    to Physical.</p>
    <p>A special case to this rule applies to the Modified Subsequent System Integrity
    (MSI) and the Modified Subsequent System Availability (MSA) which can be set to
    an additional special value of Safety (S) which is not included in the Base
    Subsequent System impact metrics. In this particular case, the special value
    will be directly used for the calculation of the score as explained in the
    section 4.2.1 below.</p>
    <p>The intent of these metrics are to define the mitigations and compensating
    controls that are in place for a given environment. It is acceptable to use the
    modified metrics to represent situations that increase the resulting score. Here
    are some examples:</p>
    <p>Example 1: The default configuration of a component may require high privileges
    to access a particular function. However, in the consumer analyst’s environment,
    administrative privileges might be granted by default without authenticating the
    user. The analyst can set Privileges Required to High and Modified Privileges
    Required to None to reflect this more serious condition in their particular
    environment.</p>
    <p>Example 2: The default configuration for a vulnerable system may be to run a
    listening service with administrator privileges, for which a compromise might
    grant an attacker Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impacts that are
    all High. Yet, in the consumer analyst’s environment, that same Internet service
    might be running with reduced privileges; in that case, the Modified
    Confidentiality, Modified Integrity, and Modified Availability might each be set
    to Low.</p>
    <p>Example 3: Systems and appliances located in an isolated network with no access
    to or from the Internet are not able to be attacked through the Wide Area
    Network (WAN). All vulnerabilities found on those systems may have the Attack
    Vector (AV) values of “Network” reduced to “Adjacent”.</p>
    <p>For brevity, only the names of the Modified Base metrics are mentioned. Each
    Modified Environmental metric has the same values as its corresponding Base
    metric, plus values of Not Defined and Safety. Not Defined is the default and
    uses the metric value of the associated Base metric.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2.1 Modified Base Metrics and Safety</strong></p>
    <p>When a system may have safety implications as a matter of how or where it is
    deployed, it is possible that exploiting a vulnerability within that system may
    have safety impact(s) which can be represented in the Environmental Metrics
    group.</p>
    <p>If the exploitation of a technical vulnerability (with impact to either the
    availability or integrity of the vulnerable system) has the potential to impact
    human safety, the modified subsequent system impact of Safety (s) should be used
    (i.e., MSI:S/MSA/S).</p>
    <p>The Safety metric value measures the impact regarding the Safety of a human
    actor or participant that can be predictably injured as a result of the
    vulnerability being exploited. Unlike other impact metric values, Safety can
    only be associated with the Subsequent System impact set and should be
    considered in addition to the N/L/H impact values for Availability and Integrity
    metrics.</p>
    <p>Note: If Safety is applicable, it should be explicitly assigned even if, and in
    addition to, impact values of H are already supplied for Availability and
    Integrity metrics.</p>
    <p>Safety impact is applicable when it is predictable that an exploited
    vulnerability may result in injuries categorized as Marginal or worse using the
    IEC 61508 definitions outlined in the chart below.</p>

    metric group is determined by the consumer. This contextual information may be
    employed differently in each consumer’s environment. No metric will have any
    impact on the final calculated CVSS score (e.g. CVSS-BTE). Organizations may
    then assign importance and/or effective impact of each metric, or
    set/combination of metrics, giving them more, less, or absolutely no effect on
    the final risk analysis. Metrics and values will simply convey additional

    <p>The intention of the Vulnerability Response Effort metric is to provide
    supplemental information on how difficult it is for consumers to provide an
    initial response to the impact of vulnerabilities for deployed products and
    services in their infrastructure. The consumer can then take this additional
    information on effort required into consideration when applying mitigations
    and/or scheduling remediation.</p>
    <p>When calculating Vulnerability Response Effort, the effort required to deploy

    <td>The actions required to respond to a vulnerability are significant and/or difficult, and may possibly lead to an extended, scheduled service impact. This would need to be considered for scheduling purposes including honoring any embargo on deployment of the selected response.  Alternatively, response to the vulnerability in the field is not possible remotely. The only resolution to the vulnerability involves physical replacement (e.g. units deployed would have to be recalled for a depot level repair or replacement). Examples include: a highly privileged driver update, microcode or UEFI BIOS updates, or software upgrades requiring careful analysis and understanding of any potential infrastructure impact before implementation. A UEFI BIOS update that impacts Trusted Platform Module (TPM) attestation without impacting disk encryption software such as Bit locker is a good recent example. Irreparable failures such as non-bootable flash subsystems, failed disks or solid-state drives (SSD), bad memory modules, network devices, or other non-recoverable under warranty hardware, should also be scored as having a High effort.</td>

    <h1 id="Vector-String">Vector String</h1>
    <p>The CVSS v4.0 vector string is a text representation of a set of CVSS metrics.
    It is commonly used to record or transfer CVSS metric information in a concise
    and machine-readable form.</p>
    <p>The CVSS v4.0 vector string begins with the label “CVSS:” and a numeric
    representation of the current version, “4.0”. Metric information follows in the
    form of a set of metrics, each preceded by a forward slash, “/”, acting as a
    delimiter. Each metric is a metric name in abbreviated form, a colon (“:”), and
    its associated metric value in abbreviated form. The abbreviated forms are
    defined earlier in this specification (in parentheses after each metric name and
    metric value, case sensitive), and are summarized in the table below.</p>
    <p>A vector string must contain metrics in the order shown in Table 23, every other
    ordering is invalid. All Base metrics must be included in a vector string.
    Threat, Environmental, and Supplemental metrics are optional, and omitted
    metrics are considered to have the value of Not Defined (X). Metrics with a
    value of Not Defined can be explicitly included in a vector string if desired.
    Systems that produce or consume CVSS v4.0 vector strings must do so in the
    following order and treat unspecified Threat, Environmental and Supplemental as
    Not Defined. A vector string must not include the same metric more than once.</p>

    <h1 id="CVSS-v4-0-Scoring">CVSS v4.0 Scoring</h1>
    <p>The CVSS v4.0 scoring methodologies are described in the sub-sections below.</p>
    <h2 id="New-Scoring-System-Development">New Scoring System Development</h2>
    <p>The scoring system development for CVSS v4.0 consisted of the following broad
    steps:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>Use metric groups to gather the 15 million CVSS-BTE vectors into 270
    disjoint equivalence sets under a relation of comparable qualitative
    severity</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Solicit experts to compare vectors representing each equivalence set</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Use the expert comparison data to calculate an order of vectors from least
    severe to most severe</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Solicit expert opinion to decide which equivalence set of vectors p in the
    ordering of vectors represents the boundary between qualitative severity
    scores to be backwards compatible with qualitative severity score boundaries
    from CVSS v3.x</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Compress the equivalence set of vectors in each qualitative severity bin
    into the number of available scores in that bin (for example, 9.0 to 10.0
    for critical, 7.0 to 8.9 for high, etc.)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Create a small score modification factor that adjusts the scores of vectors
    within a qualitatively equivalent set of vectors so that a change of any
    metric value results in a resulting score change, where possible. The intent
    is that the score change is not larger than the uncertainty in the ranking
    of the vector groups as collected from the expert comparison data in step 2.
    This is further discussed in section 8.2 below.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additional information about the new approach to scoring calculation developed
    in CVSS v4.0 can be found in Section 2.5 of the CVSS v4.0 User Guide.</p>
    <h2 id="CVSS-v4-0-Scoring-using-MacroVectors-and-Interpolation">CVSS v4.0 Scoring using MacroVectors and Interpolation</h2>
    <p>The CVSS v4.0 formula provides a mathematical approximation of all possible
    metric combinations ranked in order of severity where vectors are clustered in
    sets called <strong>MacroVectors</strong>. A MacroVector is one of the sets of CVSS vectors
    that the expert evaluation process described in section 8.1 (steps 1-3)
    determined to be of comparable qualitative severity. Each MacroVector
    constitutes an equivalence class<sup id="fnref1:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref">4</a></sup> from such a qualitative perspective.</p>
    <p>The score of a MacroVector is defined by a lookup table as defined by the
    subject matter expert process mentioned above and is specified in Section 8.3.
    The score of a vector within each MacroVector is defined by interpolation.</p>
    <p>To determine a preliminary set of relevant MacroVectors, The SIG determined the
    following preliminary metrics subgroups. Additional EQs or levels can be
    determined for a finer resolution.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>EQ1 → AV/PR/UI with 3 levels specified in Table 24</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>EQ2 → AC/AT with 2 levels specified in Table 25</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>EQ3 → VC/VI/VA with 3 levels specified in Table 26</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>EQ4 → SC/SI/SA with 3 levels specified in Table 27</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>EQ5 → E with 3 levels specified in Table 28</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>EQ6 → VC/VI/VA+CR/CI/CA with 2 levels specified in Table 29</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Intuitively, each level of a metric subgroup corresponds to a different severity
    level with zero being the most severe and one or two being the least severe.</p>
    <p>Since EQ3 and EQ6 are not independent they must be considered together</p>
    <ul>
    <li>EQ3+EQ6 → determines 5 levels specified in Table 30</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A <strong>highest severity vector</strong> of a MacroVector is a vector that</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Satisfies the boolean conditions for membership into a MacroVector</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>No other vector in the MacroVector has a higher severity in at least a
    metric</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The lowest severity vector of a MacroVector is determined in a similar way.</p>
    <p>One MacroVector might have more than one highest severity vector and more than
    one lowest severity vector. For example the MacroVectors which satisfy EQ1 at
    level 1 shown in Table 24 have as highest severity vectors all vectors with</p>
    <ul>
    <li>AV:A/PR:N/UI:N or AV:N/PR:L/UI:N or AV:N/PR:N:/UI:P</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Given two vectors the <strong>severity distance</strong> between them is the number of
    consecutive stepwise changes in individual metrics given Section 2 ordering
    needed to transform one vector into the other.</p>
    <p>For example a Vector with VC:H/VI:H/VA:H has a severity distance of 3 from a
    vector that contains VC:H/VI:<strong>L</strong>/VA:<strong>N</strong> and is otherwise identical</p>
    <ul>
    <li>VC:H/VI:H/VA:H → VC:H/VI:<strong>L</strong>/VA:H → VC:H/VI:<strong>L</strong>/VA:<strong>L</strong> →
    VC:H/VI:<strong>L</strong>/VA:<strong>N</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The <strong>depth of a MacroVector</strong> is the maximum severity distance between the
    highest severity vector(s) and the lowest severity vector(s) of the MacroVector.</p>
    <p>The notion of depth can be better understood by a graphical visualization. For
    example consider EQ3=2 which is defined in Table 26 as all metrics values such
    that not (VC=H or VI=H or VA=H). Figure 2 shows all metric values of VC, VI, and
    VA in that MacroVector starting from the highest severity vector
    (VC:L/VI:L/VA:L) to the lowest severity vector (VC:N/VI:N/VA:N).</p>
    <p><img src="media/775681a717a6816a877d808132387ebe.png" alt="" /></p>
    <p><strong>Figure 2: Vectors included MacroVector with EQ3=2 and everything else fixed.</strong></p>
    <p>The highest severity vector of a MacroVector is always assigned the score of the
    MacroVector from the cvss_lookup.js file within the CVSS v4.0 calculator
    reference implementation available on GitHub (see Section 8.3).</p>
    <p>A vector within a MacroVector is assigned the score of the highest severity
    vector in the MacroVector minus the mean proportional distance from the
    MacroVectors below it.</p>
    <p>This is obtained by the following algorithm.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>For each of the EQs</p>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>The maximal scoring difference is determined as the difference between
    the current MacroVector and the lower MacroVector</p>
    <ol>
    <li>if there is no lower MacroVector the available distance is set to
    NaN and then ignored in the further calculations</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The severity distance of the to-be scored vector from a highest severity
    vector in the same MacroVector is determined</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The proportion of the distance is determined by dividing the severity
    distance of the to-be-scored vector by the depth of the MacroVector</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The maximal scoring difference is multiplied by the proportion of
    distance</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The mean of the above computed proportional distances is computed</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>The score of the vector is the score of the MacroVector (i.e. the score of
    the highest severity vector) minus the mean distance so computed. This score
    is rounded to one decimal place.</p>
    </li>
